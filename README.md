"MEDI-SYMPTOM CHECKER"
Project Description: MEDI-SYMPTOM CHECKER is a console-based diagnostic system written in C++. The program allows users to select symptoms from a predefined list and receive possible matching diseases based on the number of matched symptoms. For each disease, the system displays the number of matched symptoms, the approximate percentage of similarity, general medical advice, and warning signs that may require urgent medical attention.
This project was developed as a final assignment for the C++ course.

Purpose of the Project: The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical knowledge of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming. Through this work, we apply theoretical concepts such as classes, data structures, algorithms, sorting, and file handling in a structured and functional application.
The project shows how C++ can be used to build a simple expert-like system that processes user input, analyzes data, and produces sorted results based on logical comparison.

Relevance and Target Audience: This project is relevant because many people search online to understand their symptoms before visiting a doctor. Our system provides a structured way to evaluate symptoms instead of relying on random internet sources.
The target audience includes students and adults who want to quickly evaluate their symptoms, as well as individuals living in remote areas with limited access to medical services. Additionally, the project can serve as an educational example of a simple diagnostic system implemented in C++.

Main Features - The program includes the following functionality:
Display a list of available symptoms;
Add and remove selected symptoms;
Show selected symptoms;
Diagnose possible diseases based on selected symptoms;
Sort diseases by number of matched symptoms and percentage of similarity;
Display medical advice and emergency warnings;
Save selected symptoms to a file (history.txt);
Menu-based console interaction.
